/* typescript is a JS superset, its not a brand new language, just adds features
 and advantages
 
 BROWSERS CANNOT execute TS, the enviornments that support JS DONT support TS
 
 So why? TS is a tool, a compiler to runover code to turn TS into JS
 results in JS, but you didnt write it! you wrote TS with new features 
 so how dot he features end up in the created JS, the TS turns the features 
 with JS snippets , complied into JS workarounds 
 
 
 2D JS langaue called types, give delopers to identify the errors earlier*/
